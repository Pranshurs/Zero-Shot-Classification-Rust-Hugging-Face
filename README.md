# zero-shot-classification-rust-hugging-face
This repository demonstrates a Rust implementation of zero-shot classification using the `rust-bert` library and Hugging Face Transformers. The project showcases how to classify text into predefined categories without requiring labeled training data.
## Key Features

- **Rust Implementation:** Utilize the performance and safety of Rust for machine learning tasks.
- **Hugging Face Transformers:** Leverage state-of-the-art models for natural language processing.
- **Zero-Shot Capability:** Perform real-time text classification without extensive training datasets.
